# C Programming Training 

A repository of C programs developed as part of ongoing training, skill development, and technical proficiency exercises.

This repository functions as a controlled environment for learning the C programming language, reinforcing fundamentals, and executing small-scale technical operations through code.

## 🎯 Mission Objective

- Develop and maintain proficiency in the C programming language
- Strengthen understanding of low-level systems concepts
- Train in memory management, pointers, and manual resource control
- Practice disciplined coding, compilation, and debugging procedures
- Execute focused programming drills and technical exercises

## ⚠️ Operational Notice

- This repository is **training-focused**
- Code quality and completeness may vary by exercise
- Some programs are intentionally minimal or incomplete
- Structure and implementation may change without notice as training progresses

## 📂 Assets

This repository may contain:
- Standalone C programs (training drills)
- Learning exercises and technical trials
- Algorithm and data structure implementations
- Systems-level experiments
- One-off programs created to validate concepts

Each asset is documented through comments and inline notes where applicable.

## 🔧 Equipment Requirements

- C compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- Command-line interface
- Unix-like operating environment recommended (Linux/macOS)

## 🏗️ Build & Execution Procedures

Standard compilation procedure:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -std=c11 program.c -o program
./program
